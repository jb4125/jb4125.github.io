	          In June of 2018, I graduated from Mamaroneck High School in Mamaroneck, NY.
            During my career at MHS, I was Captain of the Girls Varsity Soccer team,
            President of the MHS Hunger Task Force, President of the MHS Human Rights Club,
            Senior Editor of the Mahiscan Yearbook, a Peer Leader to children at my district’s middle school,
            a Tutor/Mentor at my district’s elementary school and high school,
            a member of the National Honor Society, and was a selected Student Representative (one of two)
            in the Assistant Principal Search Committee.
            I am proud to have been awarded the American Literature Award (2017) by the Department Chair of English,
            and the Varsity Scholar-Athlete Award by the NY State High School Athletic Association (2015, 2016)
            throughout my time at Mamaroneck High School.
            During the Summer of 2017, I attended the ACLU Summer Advocacy Institute at Georgetown
            and the Barnard College: Entrepreneurs-in-Training, which sparked my interests in entrepreneurship, human rights, and activism.
            Recently, I was accepted into Columbia’s JADE Program,
            a week-long immersive program to the startup ecosystem of NYC, technology, and entrepreneurship.
            I am looking forward to participating in this program, as there will be opportunities to visit companies,
            meet with founders/investors, learn introductory web development, and create my own website.
            Next Semester, I plan to take an HTML/CSS Course offered through the Athena Digital Design Agency;
            through this agency, I will learn how to code and eventually connect with local businesses
            and organizations to build or maintain their websites.
            My goal is to leave an impact and motivate the larger Latinx community in my hometown and around the world.
